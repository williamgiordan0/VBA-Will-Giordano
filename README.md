Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an event-driven programming language that enables you to extend Office applications. Here we go over some solutions.
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 
Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks.



Instructions
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

The ticker symbol.

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should look as follows.

moderate_solution

CHALLENGES
Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:
hard_solution

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
